# Catlike Coding Rendering

This Unity project contains all tutorials from the [Rendering tutorial series](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/) of the [CatLike Coding website](https://catlikecoding.com/). This series guides the reader through the process of recreating Unity's Standard Shader, focusing on the theory behind each feature of this well known "Uber shader".

Each tutorial has a dedicated folder, with at least one specific reference scene. All shaders and scripts contains comments that explain the specific additions and modifications that happened in the context of the relative tutorial.

Tested with Unity 2020.2.f1.
